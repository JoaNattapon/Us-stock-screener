# Tool used
  REACT - CSS
  
# Installation Guide
Normally you don't need any installation to use this application because I already deployed this project via Netlify. Thus, you can go directly to the link to play around with it -> https://638dfc9a3acec71e434db3dc--steady-sable-adb3eb.netlify.app/

# User Story
Once you get into main page you will see input field and search button the main feature for the landing page is you are require to put the ticker name of any Us stock you know and then click on <search> button. After that the news relate to that stock will pop up below search tap and from there you can read the detail about the news. Additionally, next to the search button you can notice blue button called <switch to find stock price> if you click on that it will link you to new url which will allow you to search for last price of any stock you want to know. After all, what I do suggest the user to be prepare for the better user experience is to at least research for ticker of any stock you wish to search because Apple inc. stock is obviously did't use <apple> or <Apple> for their stock symbol but <AAPL> is the way to go. So, please get youself familiar with the stock symbol first before play our app and I know this pain point could be improve in the application later on.

# What I've learnt from the project
  React is very useful javascript library it help you build an application that contain a lot of reuseable components a lot more easy and also you need to have at least a basic understanding of pure Javascript and Css before build any React app especially when you need to work with an API that is when you need to recall all kind of javascript method to get data from API. In conclusion, I think React is lovely javascript library and I'll keep learning it until I get a good grasp.
